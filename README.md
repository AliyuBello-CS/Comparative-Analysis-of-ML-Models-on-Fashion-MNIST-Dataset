The hotel database schema, with a Java swing UI, organizes information for managing hotel details, room information, guest profiles, reservations, services, and guest orders. Key relationships link guests to their reservations and orders, while rooms and services connect to specific hotels. SQL queries enable retrieval of room reservations, active guest reservations, a guestâ€™s total bill (including services), and vacant rooms available on specific dates.
